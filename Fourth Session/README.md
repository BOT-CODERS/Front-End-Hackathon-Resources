### What is JavaScript? - 

JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.  
Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.


### What is JavaScript used for?

JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic things JavaScript is used for:
#### 1. Adding interactive behavior to web pages
JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:
* Show or hide more information with the click of a button
* Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it
* Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage
* Zooming in or zooming out on an image
* Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
* Playing audio and video in a web page
* Displaying animations
* Using a drop-down hamburger menu.

#### 2. Creating web and mobile apps
Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications around. 
Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!

#### 3. Building web servers and developing server applications
Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js. 

#### 4. Game development
Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for beginning developers to practice their JavaScript skills. 

### Why is JavaScript so important?

#### 1. Language of the now powerful frontend

For a long time, websites were mostly powered by PHP-based CMSs, such as WordPress. Server-side code was handling the major part of the logic. Things are changing though—you might have heard that “static” sites are making a comeback. However, they’re nothing like the ‘90s statically generated websites I mentioned earlier.

Modern browsers now have the capacity to make these interactive and fully-dynamic. A particularity they share with their ancestors, though, is the abstraction of backend development. Logic is handled client-side, directly in the browser, thanks to JavaScript.

Some of the most prominent web applications around today are built using JS. Think Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and many more. If we use Facebook as an example, JavaScript enables status updates and most user interactivity. It wouldn’t have much appeal without it.These tech giants actually built their own frameworks of JavaScript, and these now allow thousands of devs to build their own web apps. You might have heard of Angular, backed by Google, and React, backed by FB. I also have to mention Vue here that, even if not supported by a tech powerhouse, completes the triad of important JS frameworks.

Other than reducing the amount of time and efforts required for developing JS-based sites and apps, these frameworks helped shape new web experiences. Take Single-Page Applications (SPA), for instance. A SPA is a website that interacts with users by dynamically rewriting a page in the browser rather than loading entire new pages from a server, making them behave more like desktop applications.

#### 2. Language of… many, many things

Yes, the primary use of JavaScript might still be for frontend web development. Truth is though, in 2019, it’s doing so much more than that.

##### → Server-side code

There were unsuccessful attempts to make JavaScript run server-side from the very beginning. Many thought it would just never become a stable backend language, until the arrival of Node.js.Today, this JS runtime is a popular tool to power web servers. This means that JS developers can use Node.js to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript, without relying on external web servers.

##### → Mobile apps

In the past, you would need other languages to develop great mobile applications, like Objective-C for iOS or Java for Android. It’s now easier than before to use JavaScript to connect to mobile APIs though. This means that you can use mobile devices features, such as the camera or localization to build JS-powered apps.Once again, this opened mobile app development to a more significant number of developers who no longer need to learn a new language.

Not only this, but the use of JavaScript in mobile apps even opened up new possibilities to make them even more performant. Take a look at Progressive Web Apps (PWA) for instance. Combining the best of the web and the best of apps, PWAs improve reliability, performance, and engagement. They enable impressive new functionalities such as offline navigation.

##### → API integrations

Developers can use JavaScript to fetch data from other sources and display it on their own site. One concept that is more promoted than ever in web development is modularity—using different tools to execute specific tasks. Well, it’s now easy to build these kinds of stack thanks to APIs, and JavaScript.

### JavaScript benefits -

* Client-side execution of the logic brings faster user experiences. With the code running directly in the browser, the need for server calls is abstracted, hence a cut in loading times. Even with the presence of a server, the fact that JS is asynchronous means that it’s able to communicate with the server in the background without interrupting the user interaction taking place in the frontend.

* Since the very beginning, JavaScript has brought user interface interactivity to the web. It now does the same for applications of all kind, helping to develop the most engaging UX. Today, frameworks like Vue.js are bringing transitions & animations to the next level.

* JavaScript is behind any good responsive web design. More and more, developers need to adapt their design across multiple browsers and devices. Combining HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript, they can do so within a single codebase.

* For developers, JS is easy to learn and fast to get into active development. Its syntax is easy and flexible for newcomers. It also simplifies the development of complex applications by enabling developers to simplify the app’s composition. The many frameworks & packages out there also ease the life of developers to some extent.

* If you haven’t got this yet, JavaScript is insanely popular. If popularity doesn’t always equal quality in life in general, it at least mean one important thing: you’ll find the solution to any problem within the community. In web development, that’s not a negligible detail. If you’re someone that needs to hire developers, that’s also a big plus, as the pool of candidates is huge.

### Future of JavaScript - 

According to Stack Overflow, a popular website used by developers to share their skills, JavaScript is used by 69.8%.

It is often remarked as a beginners’ language as it is quite easy to learn and execute. This makes it the best friend with developers! As a business person, you don’t have to go with what developers prefer.We want you to judge whether it’s really the optimum language for your custom software development project. One way to get a crystal clear image of the reality is an analysis of languages used for websites. Let’s check the insights!

One thing about JavaScript is extremely popular that it makes interactive web pages. In fact, for some people, front-end development means JavaScript development services It is well-proved through statistics as well.According to the trends evaluated by W3Techs, JavaScript is the top-notch client-side programming language. 

Since its inception in 1995, JavaScript has proved to be a dynamic language that has met the growing needs of custom web development services. This has been possible with the introduction of constant developments and innovations in its every version. No year in the past two decades has passed without JavaScript being the most used programming language. Anyone can predict the same in the future after reading the above statistics.

Although Javascript has always remained a front-end development language, Node. js has brought it to the back-end also. It's a complete stress reliever of Node. js software developers as they need to use only one language across all layers.

Undoubtedly, the various frameworks have their own established market which is constantly growing. It might be possible that some frameworks fail in the near future and some see remarkable growth.

One thing which is certain is the existence of one or the other Javascript framework in software development services. There is no chance that Javascript will lose its position as the most used language. The statistics and fact speak volumes about its bright future!
